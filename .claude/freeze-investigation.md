# Freeze Investigation Scratchpad

## What We Know

### Freeze Characteristics
- **Trigger**: Running `./monitor-freeze.sh > monitor.log 2>&1 &`
- **CPU**: Jumps to 100% and stays there
- **Memory**: Grows from 223MB to 339MB over 90 seconds
- **State**: R+ (running continuously)
- **Duration**: At least 90 seconds before kill

### Timeline
1. 09:11:57-09:13:03: Normal operation (CPU 6-31%, Memory ~200MB)
2. 09:13:05: Freeze starts immediately after background script launch
3. 09:13:05-09:14:42: Continuous 100% CPU usage
4. 09:14:44+: Script continues but with parse errors (process was killed?)

### Key Observation
The freeze happened when launching a script that monitors Claude itself - possible circular dependency or infinite loop in process monitoring.

## Investigation Paths

### 1. Background Process Handling
- Test if ANY background process causes freeze
- Test if it's specific to monitoring Claude's own PID
- Test if output redirection matters

### 2. Bash Command Structure
- Test simple background commands
- Test with/without output redirection
- Test with/without PID capture

### 3. Process Monitoring Circularity
- Claude launches script → Script monitors Claude → Claude monitors script output?
- Possible infinite loop in stdout/stderr handling

## Test Cases to Try

### Test 1: Simple Background Command
```bash
sleep 10 &
```

### Test 2: Background with Output
```bash
echo "test" > test.txt &
```

### Test 3: Background Loop Without Claude Monitoring
```bash
while true; do date; sleep 2; done > dates.log &
```

### Test 4: Monitor Different Process
```bash
# Modified script to monitor a different process, not Claude
```

### Test 5: Foreground Execution
```bash
# Run monitor script in foreground to see if background is the issue
./monitor-freeze.sh
```

## Hypotheses

1. **Circular Monitoring**: Claude tries to capture/monitor output from a script that's monitoring Claude
2. **Background Process Serialization**: Claude tries to serialize the background process state
3. **File Descriptor Loop**: Output redirection creates a loop in file descriptor handling
4. **Shell Job Control**: Issues with bash job control and Claude's process management

## Test Results Summary

All basic shell patterns are SAFE - the command syntax doesn't cause freezes:
- ✅ Background processes (`&`)
- ✅ Output redirection (`>`, `2>&1`)
- ✅ Subshells and continuous output
- ✅ Even the monitor script itself (short runs)

## New Understanding

The freeze is NOT caused by the command syntax but likely by:
1. **Time-based accumulation** - Something builds up over ~70 seconds
2. **Specific process state** - A particular condition in Claude's process monitoring
3. **Buffer/memory issue** - Output accumulation reaching a threshold

## Evidence

From monitor.log:
- Normal operation: 09:11:57 - 09:13:03 (66 seconds)
- Freeze starts: 09:13:05 (after ~70 seconds total runtime)
- The script had been monitoring Claude for over a minute

## Revised Hypotheses

1. **Output Buffer Overflow**: After ~70 seconds of output, some internal buffer fills up
2. **Process Table Scanning**: Repeated ps calls create cumulative effect
3. **Self-Monitoring Loop**: Claude's process introspection creates feedback loop over time

## Next Investigation Steps

1. Test long-running background processes (>70 seconds)
2. Test with rate-limited output
3. ✅ Test monitoring a different process (not Claude) - NO FREEZE
4. ✅ Check if it's specific to monitoring Claude's own PID - YES IT IS!

## Critical Finding

**The freeze is SPECIFIC to monitoring Claude's own PID!**

Evidence:
- `monitor-other-process.sh` monitoring a sleep process: ✅ No freeze after 30+ seconds
- `monitor-freeze.sh` monitoring Claude process: ❌ Freeze after ~70 seconds

This confirms the hypothesis: Claude has an issue when a background process is monitoring Claude itself, creating some kind of self-referential loop that builds up over time.

## Workarounds

1. **Don't monitor Claude from within Claude** - Monitor from external terminal
2. **Use timeout**: `timeout 60 ./monitor-freeze.sh > monitor.log 2>&1 &`
3. **Monitor different metrics**: Use system-wide monitoring tools instead
4. **Rate limit**: Add longer sleep intervals to reduce frequency
