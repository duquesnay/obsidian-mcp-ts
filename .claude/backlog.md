# Obsidian MCP TypeScript - Product Backlog

This backlog is a single flat priority-ordered list of user-facing capabilities.
Format: `- [status] ID: User-facing capability` where status is [ ] pending, [‚è≥] in-progress, or [x] completed.
Items from different features are intermixed based on actual development priority.
Each item requires a unique ID. Descriptions can be up to 120 characters.
The list evolves naturally: completed items at top, active work in middle, future items at bottom.
