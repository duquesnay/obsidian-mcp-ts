# Obsidian MCP TypeScript - Quality Improvement Backlog

## ü§ñ AI Agent Instructions

### Overview
This backlog decomposes quality improvement recommendations into fine-grained, incremental tasks. Each task must be implemented using the Task tool to launch a sub-agent.

### Available Agents
See `.claude/agents/README.md` for the complete list of specialized agents and their capabilities. Key agents include:
- **developer**: Primary coding partner
- **test-engineer**: TDD methodology  
- **code-quality-analyst**: Code smell detection
- **architecture-reviewer**: SOLID principles
- **backlog-manager**: Strategic project management

### Sub-Agent Task Instructions
When creating a sub-agent with the Task tool, include these instructions:

```
You are implementing task [TASK_ID]: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

Follow this TDD workflow:
1. Write failing test first (Red phase)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green phase)
3. Refactor if needed (Refactor phase)
4. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
5. Do a code review and improve the code if needed
6. Run full test suite again to ensure no regressions
7. Commit incrementally with descriptive message using format:
   - feat: for new features
   - fix: for bug fixes
   - refactor: for code improvements
   - test: for test additions

Technical context:
- This is an Obsidian MCP TypeScript server
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Ensure all tests pass before completing

IMPORTANT: Every code change MUST have corresponding tests. No feature is complete without tests.

Return a summary of:
- What was changed
- Test results
- Any issues encountered
```

### Backlog Update Template
For each task:
1. Mark as [‚è≥] when starting (work in progress)
2. Delegate to appropriate sub-agent via Task tool
3. After sub-agent completes:
   - Mark the task as [x] in the backlog
   - Add completion notes if needed
   - Update the Progress Status section
4. Use backlog-manager agent to manage backlog items and dispatch implementation work to specialists

### Success Metrics
- All tests passing after each change
- No regression in functionality
- Improved code coverage
- Reduced code duplication
- Better type safety
- Each increment adds user value

### Implementation Principles
- Each task should produce working software
- Refactor only when patterns emerge (Rule of Three)
- Test at every step - no big bang integration
- Document as you go - not at the end
- Let architecture emerge from working code

### High Priority
- [x] Q1.1: Address TODO in RecentChangesHandler.ts about content length parameter (added TODO comment in ObsidianClient documenting API limitation)
- [x] Q1.2: Address TODO in AdvancedSearchTool.ts about JsonLogic query support (AdvancedSearchTool uses structured filters, not JsonLogic)
- [x] Q1.3: Address TODO in ComplexSearchTool.ts about JsonLogic implementation (added JsonLogic validation to ensure proper query structure)

### Medium Priority

- [x] Q2.2: Extract common validation patterns into reusable functions (created ResourceValidationUtil with URI extraction, date validation, etc.)
- [x] Q2.3: Replace remaining `any` types with specific interfaces (replaced ~25 any types with proper interfaces)
- [x] Q2.4: Add stricter type checking for dynamic tool discovery (added validation for tool classes and instances)

## Code Quality Improvements from Quality Review (2025-01-24)

### Critical Fix: Integration Test Mocking Issue

### Critical Bug Fix: CreateDirectoryTool False Success 
- [x] URGENT: Fix CreateDirectoryTool reporting success when directory creation actually fails (added post-creation verification using checkPathExists())
  - (integration test revealed underlying Obsidian REST API issue with directory creation)

### High Priority (Code Organization & Maintainability)
- [x] CQ1: Move test files from src/ to tests/ (moved 8 test files, updated tsconfig to exclude test files from compilation, cleaned dist/ folder)

### Medium Priority (Architectural Improvements - Do Early)
- [x] CQ4.1: Extract IObsidianClient interface from ObsidianClient class
- [x] CQ4.2: Create AND integrate FileOperationsClient

- [x] CQ6.4: Migrate remaining tools to use schema fragments from validation.ts 
- [x] CQ7: Address TODO comments (moved getRecentChanges to FileOperationsClient) 
### High Priority (Continued)
- [x] CQ3: Create validation utilities for DRY (implemented validateRequiredArgs() helper function, created reusable schema fragments, extracted period validation, reduced validation code duplication)

### High Priority (Type Errors)
- [x] Fix TypeScript type errors blocking the build (28 errors)

### Low Priority (Type Safety & Documentation)
- [x] CQ8: Complete argument type extraction (UnifiedEditArgs extracted)

- [x] CQ9: Extract remaining magic numbers to constants (extracted PATH_VALIDATION.MAX_LENGTH, retry constants, LRU_CACHE.NO_EXPIRATION, DEFAULT_TTL_MS, TIMEOUTS constants)

- [x] CQ10: Replace any types with proper type guards (created hasHttpResponse, isToolResponse, isObsidianError type guards with comprehensive tests)

- [x] CQ11: Document complex regex patterns (extracted URL validation, path validation, markdown heading patterns to REGEX_PATTERNS object with JSDoc comments)

### Performance Fix Tasks

- [x] PF6: Make sure there is no mocks in integration tests (removed client hack)

- [x] PF4: Implement maxEntrySize limit for cache entries (added maxEntrySize option to LRUCache with TDD approach)
- [x] PF5: Add streaming/pagination for large vault operations (pagination implemented across list tools, OptimizedBatchProcessor includes streaming capabilities)

### Critical Bug Fix
- [x] CRITICAL: Fix cache invalidation test failure - getAllTags cache not invalidating on file creation (RESOLVED: Tests are now passing - 1142 tests passed)

### Performance Features Integration (Lower Priority)

## Tool-Resource Integration (High Priority - Performance Enhancement)

### Problem Analysis
Research confirmed that Claude Desktop shows resources as "connected" in Settings > Integrations but never actually uses them:
- Claude Desktop only calls `resources/list` but never `resources/templates/list` for dynamic resources
- Resources appear in submenu but Claude prefers web search over using registered resources
- This is a known limitation with active GitHub issues in both TypeScript SDK (#686) and Python SDK (#263)
- Dynamic resources like `vault://note/{path}` are invisible to Claude Desktop

### Solution: Internal Resource Integration
Tools will use resources internally for caching benefits while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### High Priority - Tool Performance Enhancement
- [x] TRI1: Update GetAllTagsTool to use vault://tags resource internally (5min cache vs fresh API call)
- [ ] TRI2: Update GetRecentChangesTool to use vault://recent resource internally (30s cache vs fresh API call)  
- [ ] TRI3: Update GetFileContentsTool to use vault://note/{path} resource internally (2min cache vs fresh API call)
- [ ] TRI4: Update SimpleSearchTool to use vault://search/{query} resource internally (1min cache vs fresh API call)
- [ ] TRI5: Update ListFilesInVaultTool to use vault://structure resource internally (5min cache vs fresh API call)
- [ ] TRI6: Update ListFilesInDirTool to use vault://folder/{path} resource internally (2min cache vs fresh API call)

### Medium Priority - Documentation & Testing
- [ ] TRI7: Update tool descriptions to mention performance improvements from internal caching
- [ ] TRI8: Add integration tests verifying tools get cached responses
- [ ] TRI9: Update README explaining the internal resource optimization
- [ ] TRI10: Document Claude Desktop resource limitation for future reference

### Benefits
- **Performance**: Significant speed improvements from caching (5min static, 2min dynamic, 30s recent)
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing tool interfaces preserved
- **Future Ready**: Resources remain available when Claude Desktop fixes the limitation
- **Transparent**: Users get benefits without changing their usage patterns
