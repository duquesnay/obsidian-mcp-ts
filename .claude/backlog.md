# Obsidian MCP TypeScript - Quality Improvement Backlog

## 🤖 AI Agent Instructions

### Overview
This backlog decomposes quality improvement recommendations into fine-grained, incremental tasks. Each task must be implemented using the Task tool to launch a sub-agent.

### Orchestration Rules
1. **MANDATORY**: Use the Task tool to create a sub-agent for EACH backlog item
2. **NEVER** implement tasks directly - always delegate to sub-agents
3. Use @./scratchpad.md as a scratchpad for tracking progress
4. Update the backlog after each sub-agent completes its task

### Sub-Agent Task Instructions
When creating a sub-agent with the Task tool, include these instructions:

```
You are implementing task [TASK_ID]: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

Follow this TDD workflow:
1. Write failing test first (Red phase)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green phase)
3. Refactor if needed (Refactor phase)
4. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
5. Do a code review and improve the code if needed
6. Run full test suite again to ensure no regressions
7. Commit incrementally with descriptive message using format:
   - feat: for new features
   - fix: for bug fixes
   - refactor: for code improvements
   - test: for test additions

Technical context:
- This is an Obsidian MCP TypeScript server
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Ensure all tests pass before completing

Return a summary of:
- What was changed
- Test results
- Any issues encountered
```

### Backlog Update Template
After each sub-agent completes:
1. Mark the task as [x] in the backlog
2. Add completion notes if needed
3. Update the Progress Status section
4. Proceed to next task

### Success Metrics
- All tests passing after each change
- No regression in functionality
- Improved code coverage
- Reduced code duplication
- Better type safety
- Each increment adds user value

### Implementation Principles
- Each task should produce working software
- Refactor only when patterns emerge (Rule of Three)
- Test at every step - no big bang integration
- Document as you go - not at the end
- Let architecture emerge from working code
