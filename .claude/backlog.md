# Obsidian MCP TypeScript - Product Backlog

This backlog is a single flat priority-ordered list of user-facing capabilities.
Format: `- [status] ID: User-facing capability` where status is [ ] pending, [⏳] in-progress, or [x] completed.
Items from different features (RSM, RPS, POI) are intermixed based on actual development priority.
IDs preserve history (RSM1.1.3 shows it came from RSM1.1) but items are not grouped by parent.
The list evolves naturally: completed items at top, active work in middle, future items at bottom.
