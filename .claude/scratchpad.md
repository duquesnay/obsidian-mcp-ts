# Scratchpad - Working Notes and Learnings

## MCP Resources Discovery Issue (2025-01-28)

### User Testing Feedback
When Claude Desktop tried to use the resources mentioned in tool descriptions:
> "I can see that the Obsidian MCP mentions these vault:// resources, but I don't have a direct way to access MCP resources. These URIs appear to be internal references that the MCP server uses for caching, but there's no function in my available tools to directly query MCP resources."

### Key Learning
- Claude Desktop correctly identifies resources as "internal references"
- Confirms that MCP resources are not accessible to Claude Desktop
- Tools remain the only way Claude can interact with the server
- The description updates help with understanding but don't enable resource access

### Implications
- Option 1 (description updates) ✅ provides education but not functionality
- Option 2 (tool wrappers using resources internally) for actual performance benefits
- **Option 3 (deactivate overlapping tools)** - Force users to access resources directly
- Resources work perfectly but remain invisible to Claude Desktop UI

### Option 3 Analysis - Tool Deactivation
**Pros:**
- Forces use of more efficient cached resources
- Eliminates confusion between tools and resources
- Simpler codebase (less duplication)
- Clear migration path

**Cons:**
- Breaking change for existing users
- Claude Desktop can't access resources directly
- Would need alternative access mechanism
- Requires major version bump

**Viable approaches if deactivating tools:**
1. Remove tools entirely (breaking)
2. Make tools return error with resource suggestion
3. Add a generic "query resource" tool that takes URI
4. Deprecate with sunset timeline

# Team Coordinator Progress Tracking

## Current Session: Comprehensive Quality Review & Backlog Completion
**Started**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: In Progress

## Phase 1: Code Quality Review
- [x] Conduct periodic code quality review - Test Results Analysis
  - **Critical Issue Confirmed**: Cache invalidation test failure in cache-integration.test.ts
  - **Overall Health**: 1141/1142 tests passing (99.9% pass rate)
  - **Status**: Codebase is generally healthy, just this one critical cache issue
- [x] Update backlog with any critical issues found - No new issues beyond known cache problem
- [x] Prioritize critical issues if found - Cache invalidation is the top priority

## Phase 2: Systematic Backlog Completion
- [ ] Work through remaining backlog items systematically
- [ ] Mark items [⏳] before starting
- [ ] Delegate to specialists
- [ ] Mark items [x] when complete

## Current Task Analysis
From backlog review:
- **Quality Tasks**: 63/63 (100% complete)
- **Resource Tasks**: 18/18 (100% complete) 
- **Quality Check Tasks**: 11/14 (78% complete)
- **Critical Issues**: 1 active [⏳] cache invalidation test failure
- **Remaining Low Priority**: Multiple documentation and benchmark tasks

## Next Actions
1. Start with quality review
2. Address critical cache invalidation issue
3. Work through remaining CQ14 and Q3 tasks systematically
