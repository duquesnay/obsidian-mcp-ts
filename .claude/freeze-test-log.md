# Freeze Investigation Test Log

## Investigation Details
- Date: 2025-01-28
- Issue: Claude Code freezes when running `./monitor-freeze.sh > monitor.log 2>&1 &`
- Symptoms: CPU 100%, Memory grows from 223MB to 339MB, infinite loop during JSON serialization

## Test Protocol
For each test:
1. Document the command
2. Run it
3. Wait 3-5 seconds
4. Check responsiveness with `echo "still alive"`
5. Document results

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Simple Background Process
**Command**: `sleep 5 &`
**Expected**: Background process runs without issue
**Executed**: 09:21:10
**Result**: Command executed successfully, no output
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately to echo command

### Test 2: Background with Output
**Command**: `echo "test" &`
**Expected**: Output "test" and continue normally
**Executed**: 09:21:46
**Result**: Output "test" as expected
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately

### Test 3: Background with File Redirect
**Command**: `echo "test" > test.txt &`
**Expected**: Write to file in background
**Executed**: 09:22:09
**Result**: File created successfully with content "test"
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately and could read the file

### Test 4: Background Subshell
**Command**: `(sleep 2; echo "done") &`
**Expected**: Subshell executes in background
**Executed**: 09:22:45
**Result**: "done" appeared after 2-second delay as expected
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately

### Test 5: Monitor Script Foreground
**Command**: `./monitor-freeze.sh` (without background)
**Expected**: Script runs in foreground
**Executed**: [Skipped - already running process found]
**Result**: Found existing monitor process was running with parse errors
**Claude Responsive**: N/A

### Test 6: Background with STDERR Redirect
**Command**: `echo "error" >&2 2> error.txt &`
**Expected**: Redirect stderr to file in background
**Executed**: 09:24:30
**Result**: Created empty error.txt, error still shown in terminal
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately

### Test 7: Background with Combined Output Redirect
**Command**: `(echo "stdout"; echo "stderr" >&2) > combined.txt 2>&1 &`
**Expected**: Redirect both stdout and stderr to same file
**Executed**: 09:24:45
**Result**: Both stdout and stderr captured in combined.txt
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded immediately

### Test 8: Continuous Output with Errors
**Command**: `./test-continuous.sh > test-output.txt 2>&1 &`
**Expected**: Script with continuous output and bc errors
**Executed**: 09:25:10
**Result**: All output captured correctly, script completed
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - responded during and after execution

---

### Test 9: Monitor Script with Timeout
**Command**: `./monitor-freeze.sh > test-monitor.log 2>&1 &` (killed after 5s)
**Expected**: Monitor script runs and captures process info
**Executed**: 09:27:50
**Result**: Script ran successfully, captured CPU/memory data correctly
**Claude Responsive**: ✅ Yes - no issues

---

## Findings Summary

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Parse Error Issue**: The monitor-freeze.sh script encounters parse errors when the `ps` command returns the header "%CPU%" instead of a numeric value. This happens when the Claude process PID is not found correctly or the ps output is malformed.

2. **The Freeze Issue is NOT caused by**:
   - Background processes (`&`)
   - Output redirection (`>`)
   - Error redirection (`2>&1`)
   - Combined stdout/stderr redirection
   - Continuous output from scripts
   - bc command parse errors

### All Tested Commands are SAFE:
- ✅ Simple background processes
- ✅ Background with stdout output
- ✅ Background with file redirection
- ✅ Background subshells
- ✅ Background with stderr redirection
- ✅ Background with combined stdout/stderr redirection
- ✅ Scripts with continuous output and errors
- ✅ The monitor-freeze.sh script itself (when PID is found correctly)

### Conclusion:
The freeze issue is likely NOT caused by the shell command syntax itself, but rather by something specific to:
1. How Claude Code handles certain process states or outputs
2. A specific condition that occurs when the monitor script runs for an extended period
3. A race condition or resource issue that wasn't triggered during these short tests

### Recommendations:
1. Fix the bc parse error by adding validation: `if [[ "$CPU" =~ ^[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$ ]]; then ...`
2. The original freeze might be related to accumulating output buffer or memory usage over time
3. Consider using `timeout` command to limit script execution time as a safety measure
