# User Story Generation Task for Documentation Writer

## Objective
Generate comprehensive user stories for all backlog items that don't already have them in `.claude/user-stories.md`.

## Current State
- File has user stories for RSM and RPS features (RSM1.1-RSM1.7, RPS1.1-RPS1.7)
- Need to create user stories for items F1-F13, P1-P2, T1-T7, N1-N8, S1-S15, E1-E15, PERF1-PERF15, OPT1-OPT15, Q1-Q15, D1-D3, I1-I4
- Total: ~110 new user stories needed

## Instructions

1. **Read existing content**:
   - Review `.claude/user-stories.md` to understand current format
   - Review `.claude/user-story-examples.md` for examples
   - Review `.claude/generate-user-stories.md` for templates

2. **Read the backlog**:
   - Get all items from `.claude/backlog.md`
   - Group items by pattern type (Create, Search, View, Edit, Performance, Quality)

3. **Generate systematically**:
   - Work through items in ID order
   - Apply appropriate template based on capability type
   - Ensure each story has:
     - User story in "As a... I want... so that..." format
     - 3-5 specific acceptance criteria
     - Brief implementation notes where helpful

4. **Quality checks**:
   - Ensure consistency with existing RSM/RPS stories
   - Make acceptance criteria measurable and specific
   - Keep implementation notes high-level (not detailed technical specs)
   - Focus on user value, not technical implementation

5. **Append to existing file**:
   - Add new stories after existing RPS section
   - Maintain the same formatting and structure
   - Group by logical sections if helpful

## File Operations

### F1: Create new notes and folders instantly
**User Story**: As an Obsidian user, I want to create new notes and folders with a single command, so that I can quickly capture ideas without interrupting my flow.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create notes with specified content in any vault location
- Create nested folder structures with parent creation
- Handle special characters in file/folder names properly
- Return success confirmation with created path
- Fail gracefully with clear errors for invalid paths

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Obsidian REST API's create endpoint
- Validate paths before creation
- Support both absolute and relative paths

### F2: Read any note in your vault with a simple command

- Suggest doing 20-30 at a time to maintain quality

## Success Criteria
- All backlog items have corresponding user stories
- Stories follow consistent format
- Focus remains on user value
- Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- File is ready for use in project planning and development
