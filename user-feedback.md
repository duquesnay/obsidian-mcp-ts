### What I Tried
I attempted to insert content at the end of a document:
```javascript
mcp__obsidian-ts-0_5-alpha__obsidian_patch_content_v2(
  filepath: "Productivity/Notes Reorganisation Project/Phase-5A-Empty-Files-Cleanup-Report.md",
  operation: {
    type: "insert", 
    insert: {
      content: "## ⚠️ CRITICAL ERROR...", 
      location: {type: "document", position: "end"}
    }
  }
)
```

### The Error
Got a complex validation error about `invalid_union` with multiple schema options expecting different content formats (text, image, audio, resource) with specific type fields.

### Pain Points

1. **Unclear content format**: The error shows I need `content[0].type` but it's not clear that content should be an array of objects with type fields

2. **No examples in error**: The error shows what's wrong but not what's right. An example of valid format would help

3. **Complex for simple tasks**: Just appending text required understanding a complex schema vs `append_content` which just works

4. **Union errors are confusing**: Multiple validation attempts shown in the error make it hard to understand which format to use

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Add examples to error messages**:
   ```
   Error: Invalid content format. Expected:
   content: [{type: "text", text: "your text here"}]
   ```

2. **Simpler shortcuts for common operations**:
   - For plain text operations, accept a string directly
   - Auto-wrap in the required format internally

3. **Better parameter documentation**:
   - Show examples for each operation type
   - Clarify when content needs to be an array vs single object

4. **Progressive disclosure**:
   - Simple mode for basic text operations
   - Advanced mode for mixed content types

5. **Type hints in tool description**:
   - Current description doesn't mention the content array structure
   - Should show example operations upfront

### What Would Make It LLM-Friendly

1. **Flat parameters for simple cases**: 
   ```javascript
   operation: "append_text",
   text: "content to append"
   ```

2. **Smart defaults**: If I'm inserting plain text, assume `[{type: "text", text: content}]`

3. **Clear operation names**: Instead of nested objects, maybe `operation_type` and `operation_params`

4. **Validation feedback**: "Did you mean to wrap your content in [{type: 'text', text: '...'}]?"

The tool seems powerful for complex operations, but the learning curve for simple tasks is steep compared to existing tools. Making common operations simpler while keeping advanced capabilities would improve adoption.

### Tools Used for Content Manipulation

I attempted to use the following tools for appending content and inserting after headings:
- `obsidian_append_content` - For simple appending to end of file
- `obsidian_patch_content` - For inserting content after headings (deprecated)
- `obsidian_patch_content_v2` - For more complex content operations
- `obsidian_patch_content_v3` - The simplified version with shortcuts

### What Was Intuitive

1. **append_content** - Very straightforward, just filepath and content
2. **patch_content_v3 shortcuts** - The simple operations like `{ append: "text" }` and `{ insertAfterHeading: { heading: "Title", content: "text" } }` were much easier to understand
3. The deprecation notice on patch_content clearly directing to v2

### What Was Confusing

1. **patch_content_v2** - The nested structure with operation types and location objects was overwhelming:
   - Had to specify `operation.type`, then nested `insert.location.type`, then further nested location details
   - The distinction between `location.position` and `location.document.position` was unclear
   - Too many options made it hard to know what was required vs optional

2. **patch_content (deprecated)** - Required targetType and target parameters that weren't immediately obvious

3. **Finding the right tool** - With patch_content, patch_content_v2, and patch_content_v3 all available, it wasn't clear which to use

### Tool Usage Pattern

I primarily fell back to simpler tools:
- Used `append_content` when I just needed to add to the end of a file
- Attempted patch_content_v2 but found the syntax too complex for simple operations
- Would have preferred patch_content_v3 if I had discovered it earlier, as its shortcuts match common use cases

### Recommendations

1. Consider hiding deprecated tools from the tool list to reduce confusion
2. The patch_content_v3 shortcuts are excellent - make these more prominent in the tool description
3. Add more examples in the tool descriptions showing common use cases
4. Consider making patch_content_v3 the primary tool and deprecating v2 for LLM usage

### Test Results from Claude Subprocess

The Claude subprocess attempting to use patch_content_v2 with the improved ergonomic shortcuts encountered the following issues:

1. **Validation Errors**: Despite the tool now having simple shortcuts like `{ append: "text" }` and `{ insertAfterHeading: { heading: "Title", content: "text" } }`, the subprocess still encountered validation errors when trying to use patch_content_v2.

2. **Tool Confusion**: The subprocess mentioned that "some MCP tools required permissions that weren't granted", suggesting permission configuration issues prevented proper testing.

3. **Fallback Pattern**: The subprocess ultimately used workarounds:
   - Used the Task tool for complex content modifications
   - Used `obsidian_append_content` for reliable file operations
   - Delegated complex operations when direct MCP tools failed

### Key Observation

Even with the ergonomic improvements (simple shortcuts merged from v3), the patch_content_v2 tool still failed to be adopted by the LLM. The subprocess preferred to fall back to simpler tools or delegate to the Task tool rather than use patch_content_v2.

### Possible Issues

1. **Build/Deployment**: The improvements might not be visible to the subprocess if the build wasn't properly deployed
2. **Permission Configuration**: The `--allowedTools` flags might need more specific configuration
3. **Tool Discovery**: The subprocess might not be seeing the updated tool description with the new shortcuts

### Next Steps

Need to verify that:
1. The improved patch_content_v2 is actually deployed and accessible
2. Permission configuration is correct for MCP tool usage
3. The tool description clearly shows the simple shortcuts in the tool listing

### Task Completion Experience

I was asked to complete three tasks on Obsidian notes:
1. Insert content after a heading in technical-spec.md
2. Replace text and add a section in project-overview.md
3. Report on the experience

### What Happened

1. **Initial Creation**: Used `obsidian_append_content` to create the initial test files - this worked perfectly
2. **patch_content_v2 Attempts**: Tried multiple approaches with patch_content_v2 but encountered complex validation errors:
   - `insertAfterHeading` syntax resulted in invalid_union errors
   - `replace` method also failed with schema validation issues
   - Complex error messages about content needing to be arrays with type fields
3. **Permission Issues**: Several tools required permissions that weren't granted (patch_content, delete_file)
4. **Successful Workaround**: Created new clean files with the required modifications using `append_content`

### What Worked Well

- `obsidian_append_content` - Simple, reliable, no confusion
- Task completion was possible through workarounds
- Error messages were detailed (though complex)

### What Was Problematic

1. **patch_content_v2 Ergonomics**: Despite supposed improvements, the tool still failed with complex validation errors
2. **Permission Management**: Multiple tools required permissions that weren't pre-granted
3. **Tool Selection Confusion**: Had to try multiple approaches to find what worked

### User Behavior

When faced with the complex patch_content_v2 errors, I naturally fell back to simpler tools that I knew would work. This suggests that even with ergonomic improvements, if the tool fails on first try, users will abandon it for reliable alternatives.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix the validation errors**: The simple shortcuts in patch_content_v2 should actually work
2. **Better permission management**: Pre-grant common permissions or provide clearer error messages
3. **Prioritize reliability**: A simple tool that works is better than a powerful tool that errors out

### Task Completion Experience

I successfully completed all three requested tasks:

1. **Technical Spec Update**: Added database and API layer sections after the Implementation heading
2. **Project Overview Update**: Replaced "Feature 1" with "Advanced Analytics" and added Conclusion section
3. **User Feedback Report**: Created this report in the local project directory

### Challenges Encountered

- The MCP patch_content_v2 tool had parameter format issues, requiring fallback to direct file writing
- File duplication occurred when using append_content, necessitating clean file recreation
- Permission requests were required for several MCP tools during the process

### Tool Usage

Used Write tool for file creation instead of Obsidian MCP tools due to parameter validation issues. This approach was more reliable for the specific formatting requirements.

### Results

All tasks completed successfully with proper content insertion and file structure maintained.

2. **Project Overview Update**: Replaced "Feature 1" with "Advanced Analytics" and added Conclusion section  
3. **User Feedback Report**: Created this report in the local project directory

### Tool Usage Pattern

For this session, I primarily used:
- `obsidian_insert_after_heading` - Failed due to invalid-target error
- `obsidian_simple_replace` - Worked perfectly for text replacement
- `obsidian_simple_append` - Worked reliably for adding content

### What Worked Well

- `obsidian_simple_replace` was intuitive and worked immediately
- `obsidian_simple_append` provided reliable content addition
- The simple tools had clear parameter requirements

### What Was Problematic

- `obsidian_insert_after_heading` failed with "invalid-target" error despite the heading existing
- Had to use append instead of precise insertion after specific headings
- The file already contained the content I was trying to insert, suggesting previous operations may have succeeded despite error messages

### User Behavior

When the precise insertion tool failed, I naturally fell back to append operations which worked reliably. This demonstrates that reliability trumps precision when tools fail unexpectedly.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix the insert_after_heading validation**: The tool should work when the heading clearly exists
2. **Better error messages**: "invalid-target" doesn't explain what's wrong with the target
3. **Consistent tool reliability**: Simple operations should work consistently

## User Report 2025-07-09 17:25

### Task Completion Experience

I was asked to complete three tasks on Obsidian notes, but encountered permission issues that prevented me from executing the MCP tools.

### What Happened

1. **Permission Barriers**: All Obsidian MCP tools required permissions that weren't granted:
   - `mcp__obsidian-ts-0_5-alpha__obsidian_insert_after_heading`
   - `mcp__obsidian-ts-0_5-alpha__obsidian_simple_replace`
   - Even basic `Bash` tool required permission

2. **Cannot Test Tool Ergonomics**: Unable to evaluate the actual tool performance due to permission restrictions

3. **Blocked Workflow**: The permission model prevented completion of the assigned tasks

### User Behavior

When faced with permission barriers, I attempted to continue with the workflow by calling the tools anyway, but was completely blocked. This represents a fundamental usability issue - users cannot evaluate or use tools when permissions aren't pre-configured.

### Recommendations

1. **Pre-grant Common Permissions**: For testing scenarios, common MCP tools should be pre-authorized
2. **Permission Management UX**: Provide clearer guidance on how to grant permissions for tool testing
3. **Fallback Options**: When permissions are denied, suggest alternative approaches or permission configuration steps

### Impact on Ergonomics Testing

This session was unable to test the actual ergonomics improvements to the MCP tools due to permission barriers. The ergonomics evaluation remains incomplete.

**Timestamp:** Thu Jul 10 13:24:59 +07 2025

**Experience Report:**

I successfully completed all the requested tasks on the Obsidian notes, but had to work around MCP tool permission issues. Here's what happened:

1. **File Creation:** Successfully created both test files in ~/ObsidianNotes/test-docs/ using bash commands.

2. **Technical Spec Modification:** Initially tried to use Obsidian MCP tools (obsidian_insert_after_heading and obsidian_patch_content_v2) but encountered permission errors. Fell back to using sed to replace "TBD" with the database and API layer content.

3. **Project Overview Updates:** Used sed to replace "Feature 1" with "Advanced Analytics" and echo to append the Conclusion section.

**Key Observations:**
- The Obsidian MCP tools required explicit permissions that weren't granted in this session
- Bash commands provided a reliable fallback for file modifications
- All requested content changes were successfully applied to the files

**Tools Used:**
- Bash (mkdir, echo, sed, cat) for file operations
- TodoWrite for task tracking
- Direct file system operations instead of Obsidian MCP due to permission constraints

The tasks were completed successfully despite the MCP tool limitations.

2. **Permission requests** - Some tools required permissions that weren't pre-granted
3. **Tool selection** - Had to try multiple approaches to find what worked

### User Behavior

When the precise insertion tool failed, I adapted by using text replacement instead of insertion. This demonstrates that users will find workarounds when tools fail, but the primary tool should work reliably.

### Key Observation

The simple tools (replace, append) worked consistently and were easy to use. The more complex tools (insert_after_heading) had reliability issues that forced workarounds.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix the insert_after_heading reliability**: Should work when the heading clearly exists
2. **Consistent tool performance**: Simple operations should work every time
3. **Better error messages**: More specific feedback about what's wrong with the target

## User Report 2025-07-10 15:55

### Task Completion Experience

I successfully completed all three requested tasks:

1. **Technical Spec Update**: Used `obsidian_simple_replace` to replace "## Implementation\n\nTBD" with the complete implementation section including Database Layer and API Layer subsections.

2. **Project Overview Updates**: Used `obsidian_simple_replace` twice - once to replace "Feature 1" with "Advanced Analytics" and once to add the Conclusion section after the Status section.

3. **File Creation**: Created this user-feedback.md file in the current working directory using the Write tool.

### Tool Performance

- Initial attempt with `obsidian_insert_after_heading` failed with "invalid-target" error
- `obsidian_simple_replace` worked reliably for all text replacements
- The simple replace tool handled multi-line replacements effectively
- No permission issues once using the simple replace tool

### User Experience

The simple replace tool proved most effective for these structured document modifications. The error with insert_after_heading suggests the tool may require specific content structure or permissions that weren't met in this test scenario.

### Key Observation

The `obsidian_simple_replace` tool was intuitive and worked immediately for both single-line and multi-line replacements. This represents a significant improvement in usability compared to the complex `patch_content_v2` tool.

## User Report - 2025-07-10 14:30

### Task Completion Experience

Successfully completed all requested tasks using the new ergonomic Obsidian MCP tools:

1. **obsidian_converse_with_doc Performance**: The natural conversation tool worked well for most operations. Key observations:
   - Simple commands like "replace X with Y" worked flawlessly
   - "add item" correctly understood context (adding to features list)
   - "insert between sections" worked properly
   - One command failed: "go to Implementation section" - needed to use direct content addition instead
   - Tool provided helpful error messages and section listings

2. **Task Complexity Handling**: The tool handled complex multi-step operations efficiently:
   - Successfully inserted technical content after specific text ("TBD line")
   - Properly positioned new sections between existing ones
   - Maintained document structure and formatting

3. **Error Recovery**: When one command failed, the tool continued processing the remaining commands, which was helpful for batch operations.

4. **Overall Experience**: The conversational interface felt intuitive and matched natural editing workflows. The tool successfully completed 7 out of 8 commands across both documents, with only one minor navigation issue.

### Recommendation
The obsidian_converse_with_doc tool is highly effective for complex document editing tasks that involve multiple operations. It's particularly good for content insertion and replacement operations.

### UnifiedEditTool Test Results

**CRITICAL FAILURE**: UnifiedEditTool (obsidian_edit) failed with 100% failure rate
- Every operation failed with 'Request failed: self-signed certificate' error
- Tool is completely unusable in current state
- Cannot perform any document operations

**Recommendation**: DO NOT center architecture around UnifiedEditTool. Keep simple tools as primary interface.
