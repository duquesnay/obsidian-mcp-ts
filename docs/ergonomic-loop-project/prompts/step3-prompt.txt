Implement the solution proposed in the most recent Solution Exploration section of ./llm-ergonomics-analysis.md.

Focus on faithful execution of the design, not introducing new ideas. The creativity happened in Step 2 - now build exactly what was designed.

Target: ./src/tools/ directory and any new files needed.

CRITICAL: After implementation, run 'npm run build' and verify the build succeeds. If build fails, fix errors and rebuild. The Claude process in Step 4 will only see changes after successful build.

CRITICAL - YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS STEP: After completing your implementation, document what you built and why at the end of ./implementation-log.md. Add a new section with the CURRENT timestamp. Use `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` to get the timestamp. Format: '## Implementation Log YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' describing what you implemented, the reasoning behind your choices, and what you expect the impact to be.

The implementation is NOT complete without this documentation. This is a required deliverable.

COMMIT GUIDANCE: When committing, use explicit descriptive messages with step markers:
- "ergo: step3 - implement [specific feature] for [specific purpose]"
- Example: "ergo: step3 - implement simplified append shorthand for patch_content_v2"
- Example: "ergo: step3 - add natural language operation mapping to reduce cognitive load"
Commit only the implementation and its documentation, not unrelated changes.
