Review the current text editing tools in ./src/tools/ and the last 2-3 user feedback entries to understand actual usage patterns.

Focus on:
1. Tool Clarity: Do the tools clearly communicate their purpose and usage?
2. User Experience: Are the interfaces intuitive for complex operations?
3. Error Handling: Do errors help LLMs succeed on retry?
4. Discoverability: Can LLMs easily understand when each tool is appropriate?

Examine:
- Tool descriptions
- Parameter schemas
- Error messages
- Code maintainability
- Recent usage patterns

Suggest specific refinements that improve the user experience and document them in ./llm-ergonomics-analysis.md.

Also append a summary of your refinement suggestions to the Obsidian note at "/Coding/AI/Obsidian MCP Ergo refinement log" with timestamp.

COMMIT GUIDANCE: When committing refinements, use: "ergo: step5 - refine [specific aspect] to [achieve specific goal]"
Example: "ergo: step5 - refine tool descriptions to clarify when to use each editing approach"
