# Ergonomic Loop Project Migration Summary

## Date: 2025-01-14

This document summarizes the reorganization of the ergonomic improvement loop files into a self-contained project.

## Files Moved

### From Root Directory
- `ergonomics-loop.sh` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/scripts/`

### From docs/
- `step1-prompt.txt` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/prompts/`
- `step2-prompt.txt` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/prompts/`
- `step3-prompt.txt` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/prompts/`
- `step4-prompt.txt` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/prompts/`
- `step5-prompt.txt` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/prompts/`
- `claude-wrapper.sh` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/scripts/`
- `resume-wrapper.sh` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/scripts/`
- `ergonomics-loop.sh` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/scripts/`
- `ergonomics-cycle-prompt.md` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/docs/`
- `llm-ergonomic-migration-guide.md` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/results/`

### From docs/logs/
- All `step*-debug-*.jsonl` files → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/logs/`
- `ergonomics-cycle.log` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/logs/`

### From worktrees/llm-ergonomic-patch/
- `llm-ergonomics-analysis.md` → `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/results/` (copied)

## New Files Created

- `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/docs/retrospective-analysis.md` - Extracted from CLAUDE.md

## Changes Made

### Script Updates
- Updated all paths in `ergonomics-loop.sh` to work from new location
- Updated log directory path in `claude-wrapper.sh`

### Documentation Updates
- Removed detailed retrospective from main `CLAUDE.md`
- Added reference to the new project location in `CLAUDE.md`

## Result

The ergonomic improvement loop is now a self-contained project in `docs/ergonomic-loop-project/` with:
- Clear directory structure
- Updated scripts that work from their new location
- Comprehensive documentation
- All historical logs and results preserved
- Ready to be used as a template for other tool ergonomic analyses
