# LLM-Ergonomic Patch Content Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Query Structure Tool (`obsidian_query_structure`)

A new tool that allows LLMs to inspect document structure before making modifications:

- **Purpose**: Eliminates ambiguity by letting LLMs see all headings, blocks, and structure
- **Features**:
  - Returns full heading paths (e.g., `["Implementation", "Overview"]`)
  - Adds occurrence numbers for duplicate headings
  - Provides line numbers for precise targeting
  - Includes metadata like content presence and children count

### 2. Patch Content V2 Tool (`obsidian_patch_content_v2`)

A redesigned content modification tool with LLM-ergonomic API:

- **Explicit Operations**: Clear operation types (`replace`, `insert`, `update_frontmatter`)
- **Deterministic Targeting**: 
  - Heading paths with occurrence numbers
  - Block IDs for absolute precision
  - Pattern matching with regex support
- **Structured Errors**: Machine-readable error codes with suggestions

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Explicit Over Simple

Instead of simplifying for humans, we made everything explicit for LLMs:

```typescript
// Not this (ambiguous):
{ heading: "Overview", insertAfter: true }

// But this (deterministic):
{
  operation: {
    type: "insert",
    insert: {
      location: {
        type: "heading",
        heading: {
          path: ["Implementation", "Overview"],
          occurrence: 2
        },
        position: "after"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Query-First Workflow

LLMs should query structure before modifying:

1. Query document structure
2. Analyze results to find exact targets
3. Build unambiguous operations
4. Handle errors programmatically

### 3. Backward Compatibility

- Original `patch_content` remains available
- New tools are additions, not replacements
- Migration path provided in documentation

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Query structure tool with heading/block detection
- ✅ Basic patch content v2 with replace/insert operations
- ✅ Structured error responses
- ✅ Documentation and examples
- ✅ TypeScript types and build configuration

### Simplified for Demo
- Frontmatter operations (basic implementation)
- Section-scoped replacements (marked as not implemented)
- Full heading path resolution (simplified version)

### Future Enhancements
- Complete document parsing with AST
- Full section-aware operations
- Advanced frontmatter merge/append operations
- Pattern-based insertion
- Block reference creation

## Why This Approach Works

### For LLMs
1. **No Ambiguity**: Every reference is deterministic
2. **Predictable**: Explicit parameters mean clear outcomes
3. **Recoverable**: Structured errors enable retry strategies
4. **Validatable**: Schema expresses all constraints

### For MCP
1. **Stateless**: Each operation is self-contained
2. **REST-Compatible**: Maps to existing Obsidian REST API
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new operation types
4. **Tool Composition**: Query + Patch work together

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
// 1. LLM queries structure
const structure = await query_structure({
  filepath: "doc.md",
  query: { type: "headings" }
});

// 2. LLM finds target
const target = structure.headings.find(h => 
  h.text === "Budget" && h.path.includes("Planning")
);

// 3. LLM builds operation
await patch_content_v2({
  filepath: "doc.md",
  operation: {
    type: "insert",
    insert: {
      content: "New content",
      location: {
        type: "heading",
        heading: {
          path: target.path,
          occurrence: target.occurrence
        },
        position: "after"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates how to design APIs specifically for LLM consumers rather than humans. By embracing explicitness and structure, we create tools that LLMs can use reliably and deterministically.
