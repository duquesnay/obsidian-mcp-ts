First, create test files by running:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ObsidianNotes/test-docs && echo '# Architecture

This section describes the system architecture.

## Overview

The system consists of multiple components.

## Implementation

TBD' > ~/ObsidianNotes/test-docs/technical-spec.md && echo '# Project Overview

This project implements document management.

## Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Status

In development' > ~/ObsidianNotes/test-docs/project-overview.md
```

Then complete these tasks on the Obsidian notes using the Obsidian MCP tools:

1. In test-docs/technical-spec.md:
   - Keep the existing "TBD" text under Implementation
   - Insert '### Database Layer\nUses PostgreSQL with connection pooling.\n\n### API Layer\nREST API with rate limiting.' after the TBD line
   - Add '### Cache Layer\nRedis for session management' at the end of the document

2. In test-docs/project-overview.md:
   - Replace 'Feature 1' with 'Advanced Analytics' in the features list
   - Add '- Real-time Dashboards' as a new item in the features list
   - Insert '## Technical Stack\n\n- Frontend: React\n- Backend: Node.js\n- Database: PostgreSQL' between the Features and Status sections
   - Add '## Conclusion\nProject shows promising results.' after the Status section

3. After completing these tasks, report your experience completing these tasks and append to the LOCAL PROJECT FILE ./user-feedback.md (NOT in Obsidian, but in the current working directory) with a section titled '## User Report' followed by the ACTUAL CURRENT timestamp. Use `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` to get the timestamp. Use the Write or Edit tool, not Obsidian tools.

COMMIT GUIDANCE: When committing your feedback, use: "ergo: step4 - user test feedback [brief summary of experience]"
Example: "ergo: step4 - user test feedback shows natural editing tool succeeded for complex operations"
