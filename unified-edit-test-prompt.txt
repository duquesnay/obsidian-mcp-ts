CRITICAL MISSION: Test UnifiedEditTool (obsidian_edit) extensively to determine if we should recenter our tool architecture around it.

The test files already exist in ~/ObsidianNotes/test-docs/

Complete these tasks using ONLY the obsidian_edit tool (mcp__obsidian-ts-0_5-alpha__obsidian_edit):

1. In test-docs/technical-spec.md:
   - Keep the existing "TBD" text under Implementation
   - Insert '### Database Layer\nUses PostgreSQL with connection pooling.\n\n### API Layer\nREST API with rate limiting.' after the TBD line
   - Add '### Cache Layer\nRedis for session management' at the end of the document

2. In test-docs/project-overview.md:
   - Replace 'Feature 1' with 'Advanced Analytics' in the features list
   - Add '- Real-time Dashboards' as a new item in the features list
   - Insert '## Technical Stack\n\n- Frontend: React\n- Backend: Node.js\n- Database: PostgreSQL' between the Features and Status sections
   - Add '## Conclusion\nProject shows promising results.' after the Status section

PARAMETER FORMATS TO TEST:
- Simple append: { file: "path", append: "content" }
- Insert after heading: { file: "path", after: "Implementation", add: "content" }
- Replace text: { file: "path", find: "Feature 1", replace: "Advanced Analytics" }
- Insert before heading: { file: "path", before: "Status", add: "content" }

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use ONLY obsidian_edit tool - DO NOT fall back to other tools
2. Document exact parameter formats you use
3. Report exact success/failure for each operation
4. Note any error messages and whether they're helpful
5. Compare ease of use to simple_replace/simple_append

After completing, report your experience by appending to ./user-feedback.md with:
## User Report [current timestamp]

Use `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` for timestamp.

Your results will determine whether we center our architecture around this unified tool or keep the simple tools.
