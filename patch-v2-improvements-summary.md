# PatchContentToolV2 Ergonomics Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Based on the user feedback and ergonomics analysis, I've implemented the following improvements to make `PatchContentToolV2` more LLM-friendly:

### 1. Fixed Content Format Confusion
- **Issue**: Error messages suggested content should be an array of objects with type fields
- **Fix**: Simplified the interface to accept content as a plain string, matching what LLMs naturally expect
- **Before**: `content: string | Array<{ type: 'text'; text: string }>`
- **After**: `content: string`

### 2. Improved Error Messages with Examples
- **Issue**: Complex validation errors without guidance
- **Fix**: Added contextual error suggestions with working examples
- **Features**:
  - Error-specific suggestions based on the failure type
  - Complete working examples in error messages
  - Hints directing users to simpler tools when appropriate

### 3. Clarified Position Specifications
- **Issue**: Redundant position fields causing confusion (location.position vs location.document.position)
- **Fix**: 
  - Made location.position optional (removed from required fields)
  - Clarified in schema description when each position field is used
  - Updated tool description with clear examples showing which position field to use for each operation type

### 4. Enhanced Tool Description
- **Before**: Technical description without examples
- **After**: Clear examples for common operations with notes about position field usage:
  ```
  - Append to document: operation.type="insert", insert.content="text", insert.location.type="document", location.document.position="end" (no location.position needed)
  - Insert after heading: operation.type="insert", insert.location.type="heading", location.heading.path=["Heading Name"], location.position="after"
  ```

### 5. Better Validation Messages
- **Issue**: Missing operation details resulted in cryptic errors
- **Fix**: Added explicit checks with helpful examples when operation sub-objects are missing
- **Example**: When replace object is missing, shows complete working example

### 6. Smart Error Suggestions
- **New method**: `getSuggestionsForError` provides context-aware help
- **Detects common issues**:
  - Content format problems
  - Missing required fields
  - Position field confusion
- **Provides actionable guidance** including alternative tools

### 7. Document Operation Improvements
- **Issue**: Document operations only handled "end" position
- **Fix**: Now supports all document positions:
  - `start`: Insert at beginning
  - `end`: Append to end
  - `after_frontmatter`: Insert after YAML frontmatter

## Key Ergonomic Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Examples show simple cases first, complexity only when needed
2. **Error as Teacher**: Errors now guide users toward correct usage with examples
3. **Conceptual Clarity**: Position fields are clearly explained for their specific contexts
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Better error messages at each failure point

## Result

The tool maintains its powerful capabilities while becoming more approachable for LLMs. Common operations are now easier to understand through examples, and errors provide clear paths to success rather than frustration.

## Next Steps

Users experiencing friction with this tool should now:
1. See clearer examples in the tool description
2. Get helpful error messages with working examples
3. Understand which position field to use for their operation type
4. Be directed to simpler alternatives (append_content, patch_content_v3) when appropriate
