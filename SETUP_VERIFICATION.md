# Worktree Setup Verification

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 3 worktrees are properly configured and ready for parallel development.

---

## Worktree Configuration

### Worktree 1: Main Reference
```
Location: /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts
Branch:   main (1280a5f)
Status:   ✅ Up to date with origin/main
Purpose:  Reference copy and documentation
Usage:    Review baseline, run tests, merge PRs
```

### Worktree 2: Baseline Fixes (ACTIVE)
```
Location: /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes
Branch:   fix/baseline-test-failures (2dcc539)
Status:   ✅ Ready for development
Purpose:  Fix the 6 failing tests
Usage:    Main development worktree for baseline work
```

### Worktree 3: SDK Migration (ACTIVE)
```
Location: /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration
Branch:   feat/sdk-migration-wt → feat/sdk-migration (c16e5f4)
Status:   ✅ Ready for development
Purpose:  Continue SDK v1.20.2 upgrade
Usage:    Parallel development for SDK work
```

---

## What's Working

✅ All worktrees created from same repository
✅ Each worktree has independent git branch tracking
✅ Independent node_modules (npm install per worktree)
✅ Independent build artifacts (dist/ per worktree)
✅ Git history preserved across all worktrees
✅ Documentation files committed to main

---

## How to Verify Setup

### 1. Check All Worktrees Exist
```bash
git worktree list
```

Expected output:
```
/Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts                 1280a5f [main]
/Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes  2dcc539 [fix/baseline-test-failures]
/Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration   c16e5f4 [feat/sdk-migration-wt]
```

### 2. Verify Branch Tracking
```bash
# Baseline fixes
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes
git branch --show-current
# Expected: fix/baseline-test-failures

# SDK migration
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration
git branch --show-current
# Expected: feat/sdk-migration-wt
```

### 3. Check Test Failures Visible
```bash
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes
npm test 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Expected: Shows "6 failed | 1533 passed"

### 4. Verify SDK Migration State
```bash
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration
git status
git log --oneline -n 3
```

Expected: SDK migration branch with upgrade commits visible

## Starting Your Work

### Step 1: Begin with Baseline Fixes

```bash
# Navigate to baseline fixes worktree
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Review the failures
npm test 2>&1 | grep "FAIL\|expected"

# Read investigation guide
cat /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts/BASELINE_FAILURES_SUMMARY.md

# Start fixing failures
nano src/resources/RecentHandler.ts  # Start with failure #3
npm test -- RecentChangesHandler.migration.test.ts  # Test as you go
```

### Step 2: Switching to SDK Migration (When Ready)

```bash
# Switch to SDK migration worktree
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Run development mode
npm run dev

# Continue SDK upgrade work
# No interaction with baseline fixes needed
```

### Step 3: Merging Baseline Fixes

```bash
# When all 6 tests pass in baseline fixes worktree
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes

# Verify all tests pass
npm test
# Expected: "Test Files  0 failed | X passed"

# Commit your work
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: resolve 6 baseline test failures"

# Switch to main and merge
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge fix/baseline-test-failures

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Updating SDK Migration with Baseline Fixes

```bash
# After baseline fixes are merged to main
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration

# Update with baseline fixes
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Ensure tests still pass
npm test

# Continue SDK migration work
npm run dev
```

---

## Key Commands for Your Workflow

### Navigation (from any directory)
```bash
# To baseline fixes
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes

# To SDK migration
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-sdk-migration

# To main
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts
```

### Development (in appropriate worktree)
```bash
# Install dependencies (per worktree)
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Specific test file
npm test -- TagManagementClient.test.ts
```

### Git Operations (per worktree)
```bash
# Check what branch you're on
git branch --show-current

# See your commits
git log --oneline -n 5

# Commit your work
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: your fix description"

# Sync with remote
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

## File References

### Documentation Files (on main)
- **WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md** - Complete workflow guide
- **BASELINE_FAILURES_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed failure analysis
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick commands and navigation
- **SETUP_VERIFICATION.md** - This file

### Code Files to Investigate

**For Failures #1-2 (Tag API):**
- `/Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes/src/obsidian/services/TagManagementClient.ts`
- `/Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes/tests/TagManagementClient.test.ts`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Command not found: node_modules/.bin/..."
**Solution**: Run `npm install` in the worktree where you're working
```bash
cd /Users/guillaume/dev/tools/mcp/obsidian-mcp-ts-baseline-fixes
npm install
```

### Issue: "git worktree: cannot lock: ..."
**Solution**: Clean up stale worktree entries
```bash
git worktree prune
```

### Issue: Build fails in one worktree but not the other
**Solution**: Independent builds - ensure you ran `npm install` in that worktree
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

### Issue: Tests pass locally but need to verify for CI
**Solution**: Run the full test suite including build
```bash
npm run build && npm test
```

---

## Timeline & Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
- Review BASELINE_FAILURES_SUMMARY.md for failure details
- Switch to baseline-fixes worktree
- Start investigating failure #3 (metadata timeout)

### Short-term (Next Fix)
- Fix failure #3 (unblocks #4)
- Retest failure #4 (may self-resolve)
- Fix failure #2 (API format)
- Fix failure #1 (test mocks)

### Medium-term (Merge)
- Merge fix/baseline-test-failures to main
- Rebase feat/sdk-migration-wt on main (gets baseline fixes)
- Continue SDK migration work

### Long-term (Complete)
- Merge SDK migration to main
- Both efforts complete
- Green line achieved
