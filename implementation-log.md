### What I Implemented

Based on the Solution Exploration from 2025-07-10 14:04, I implemented three new ergonomic tools for the Obsidian MCP:

1. **ObsidianConverseTool** (`obsidian_converse_with_doc`)
   - Enables natural conversation with documents
   - Commands like "show me headings", "go to Features", "add item X"
   - Bidirectional communication (queries return info, commands modify)
   - Context preservation between commands in a conversation flow

2. **ObsidianSmartBlockTool** (`obsidian_add_smart_block`)
   - Semantic content blocks that understand document structure
   - 10 block types: installation, api_reference, troubleshooting, changelog, etc.
   - Automatic section detection and creation
   - Smart positioning based on document conventions

3. **ObsidianDiffEditTool** (`obsidian_apply_diff`)
   - Visual diff format using familiar +/- syntax
   - Fuzzy context matching for flexibility
   - Preview mode for safe editing
   - Inspired by git diff format that developers already know

### Reasoning Behind Choices

1. **Flat Parameter Structure**: All tools use simple, flat parameters - no nested objects or complex schemas that caused validation errors in previous attempts.

2. **Multiple Paradigms**: Different tools for different mental models:
   - Conversation for interactive exploration
   - Smart blocks for semantic content
   - Diffs for precise visual edits

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple operations work immediately, advanced features are optional.

4. **Familiar Concepts**: Used patterns LLMs already understand (conversation, semantic blocks, diff format).

### Expected Impact

- **Immediate Success**: Common operations should work on first attempt
- **Natural Usage**: Tools match how LLMs think about document editing
- **Trust Building**: Predictable behavior with helpful errors
- **Reduced Friction**: No complex validation or nested structures

### Technical Details

- All tools extend BaseTool and implement proper error handling
- Used McpError with appropriate error codes
- Implemented robust path validation
- Added comprehensive examples in tool descriptions
- Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors

### Test Readiness

The tools are compiled and ready for testing by Claude processes in Step 4. The key will be whether LLMs naturally discover and use these tools over the existing ones.

### What I Implemented

Based on the Solution Exploration from 2025-07-10 15:21, I implemented the **Progressive Reliability Architecture** as a single unified tool:

1. **UnifiedEditTool** (`obsidian_edit`)
   - Progressive complexity: simple operations (100% reliability) → structure-aware (90%+) → complex operations (80%+)
   - Single interface that scales from dead simple to complex without breaking reliability
   - Flat parameter structure with smart routing based on provided parameters
   - Comprehensive error recovery with working alternatives

### Key Design Principles Implemented

1. **Stage 1: Dead Simple Operations (100% reliability)**
   - `{ file: "doc.md", append: "text" }` - Direct append with zero complexity
   - Uses reliable `appendContent` method under the hood
   - Must never fail for well-formed requests

2. **Stage 2: Structure-Aware Operations (90%+ reliability)**  
   - `{ file: "doc.md", after: "Implementation", add: "text" }` - Insert after heading
   - `{ file: "doc.md", before: "References", add: "text" }` - Insert before heading
   - `{ file: "doc.md", find: "old", replace: "new" }` - Text replacement
   - `{ file: "doc.md", new_section: "Title", at: "end", content: "..." }` - Section creation

3. **Stage 3: Complex Operations (80%+ reliability acceptable)**
   - `{ file: "doc.md", batch: [...] }` - Multi-point operations with partial success handling

### Reasoning Behind Choices

1. **Single Tool Philosophy**: Instead of tool proliferation (v1, v2, v3), one tool that intelligently routes based on parameters eliminates decision paralysis.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple operations require minimal parameters and use the most reliable code paths. Complexity is opt-in through additional parameters.

3. **Error Recovery Focus**: When operations fail, the tool provides working alternatives rather than just error messages. This helps LLMs succeed on retry.

4. **Reliability-First Architecture**: Simple operations use the most reliable underlying methods (appendContent for appends, direct file operations for replacements).

5. **Natural Parameter Patterns**: Parameters match how LLMs describe operations:
   - "append this" → `append: "text"`
   - "add after heading" → `after: "heading", add: "text"`
   - "replace X with Y" → `find: "X", replace: "Y"`

### Expected Impact

- **First-Attempt Success**: Simple operations should work immediately without validation errors
- **Trust Building**: Reliable simple operations build confidence for trying complex ones
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One tool to learn instead of choosing between multiple versions
- **Smart Routing**: LLMs don't need to understand complex schemas - tool infers intent from parameters
- **Graceful Degradation**: Complex operations that fail suggest simpler working alternatives

### Technical Implementation Details

- Extends BaseTool with proper error handling and McpError integration
- Uses existing ObsidianClient methods but routes to most reliable operations first
- Smart parameter detection eliminates need for nested operation objects
- Comprehensive examples in tool description using copy-paste ready format
- Build completed successfully with TypeScript compilation

### Test Readiness

The UnifiedEditTool is compiled and ready for Step 4 testing. The key success metric will be whether LLMs naturally choose this tool over existing alternatives when given unbiased access to all tools. The progressive reliability architecture should make simple operations as trustworthy as `obsidian_simple_append` while enabling complex operations that existing simple tools cannot handle.
