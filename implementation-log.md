### What I Implemented

Based on the Solution Exploration from 2025-07-10 14:04, I implemented three new ergonomic tools for the Obsidian MCP:

1. **ObsidianConverseTool** (`obsidian_converse_with_doc`)
   - Enables natural conversation with documents
   - Commands like "show me headings", "go to Features", "add item X"
   - Bidirectional communication (queries return info, commands modify)
   - Context preservation between commands in a conversation flow

2. **ObsidianSmartBlockTool** (`obsidian_add_smart_block`)
   - Semantic content blocks that understand document structure
   - 10 block types: installation, api_reference, troubleshooting, changelog, etc.
   - Automatic section detection and creation
   - Smart positioning based on document conventions

3. **ObsidianDiffEditTool** (`obsidian_apply_diff`)
   - Visual diff format using familiar +/- syntax
   - Fuzzy context matching for flexibility
   - Preview mode for safe editing
   - Inspired by git diff format that developers already know

### Reasoning Behind Choices

1. **Flat Parameter Structure**: All tools use simple, flat parameters - no nested objects or complex schemas that caused validation errors in previous attempts.

2. **Multiple Paradigms**: Different tools for different mental models:
   - Conversation for interactive exploration
   - Smart blocks for semantic content
   - Diffs for precise visual edits

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple operations work immediately, advanced features are optional.

4. **Familiar Concepts**: Used patterns LLMs already understand (conversation, semantic blocks, diff format).

### Expected Impact

- **Immediate Success**: Common operations should work on first attempt
- **Natural Usage**: Tools match how LLMs think about document editing
- **Trust Building**: Predictable behavior with helpful errors
- **Reduced Friction**: No complex validation or nested structures

### Technical Details

- All tools extend BaseTool and implement proper error handling
- Used McpError with appropriate error codes
- Implemented robust path validation
- Added comprehensive examples in tool descriptions
- Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors

### Test Readiness

The tools are compiled and ready for testing by Claude processes in Step 4. The key will be whether LLMs naturally discover and use these tools over the existing ones.
