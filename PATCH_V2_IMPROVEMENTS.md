# PatchContentToolV2 Ergonomic Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Based on the LLM ergonomics analysis, the following improvements were implemented to reduce friction and improve adoption of the `patch_content_v2` tool:

### 1. Intelligent Parameter Detection

Added `detectUserIntent()` method that:
- Detects common mistakes early (e.g., array format for content)
- Provides immediate guidance before attempting operations
- Suggests simpler alternatives when appropriate
- Catches mixed operation formats

Example: If an LLM tries `{append: [{type: 'text', text: 'content'}]}`, it immediately gets guidance to use `{append: 'content'}` instead.

### 2. Enhanced Content Normalization

Improved `normalizeContent()` to:
- Handle array formats transparently
- Support legacy content formats
- Extract text from various object structures
- Provide clear string output regardless of input format

This addresses the critical type mismatch issue where the interface suggested strings but runtime expected arrays.

### 3. Context-Aware Error Messages

Added `enhanceErrorWithContext()` that provides:
- Specific guidance based on the attempted operation
- Working examples that would have succeeded
- Suggestions for alternative tools when appropriate
- Clear explanations of what went wrong

### 4. Improved Operation Detection

Enhanced `detectOperation()` to:
- Support `undefined` checks for empty string operations
- Detect simple operations wrapped in complex format
- Provide warnings via console for suboptimal usage
- Support legacy format detection
- Infer intent from partial parameters

### 5. Better Error Examples

Restructured error messages to:
- Show "most common" operations prominently
- Include tips about alternative tools
- Provide step-by-step guidance for complex cases
- Use emojis sparingly for clarity (ðŸ’¡ for tips)

### 6. Smarter Pattern Matching

Enhanced `getSimilarPatterns()` to:
- Show context around partial matches
- Provide specific fix suggestions
- Handle regex special characters properly
- Suggest using search tools first

### 7. Heading Error Improvements

Updated heading-related errors to:
- Show the exact heading that wasn't found
- Provide numbered tips for resolution
- Suggest using `obsidian_query_structure` first
- Detect common mistakes (e.g., including # symbols)

## Key Ergonomic Wins

1. **Fail Fast with Guidance**: Detects common mistakes before attempting operations
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple operations remain simple, complexity only when needed
3. **Trust Building**: Consistent string handling builds confidence
4. **Error as Teacher**: Every error provides a learning opportunity
5. **Tool Synergy**: Guides users to complementary tools when appropriate

## Testing

All improvements are covered by comprehensive unit tests including:
- Array content normalization
- Parameter suggestion detection
- Mixed format warnings
- Enhanced error messages

The tool now provides a much smoother experience for LLMs, reducing the cognitive load for simple operations while maintaining full power for complex use cases.
